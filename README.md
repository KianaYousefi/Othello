# Othello
This project is a C++ implementation of the Othello (Reversi) board game, featuring a dynamic two-player experience. The game includes essential functionalities like move validation, coin flipping, undo/redo options, and automated scoring. Players alternate turns to strategically place their pieces, aiming to dominate the board. The code emphasizes modularity with functions for game mechanics, board display, and user interaction, making it both an educational tool and a fun programming endeavor.
